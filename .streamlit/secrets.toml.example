# Snowflake Connection Configuration
# Copy this file to .streamlit/secrets.toml and fill in your credentials
# 
# For production, consider using:
# - Key pair authentication
# - Snowflake's native authentication
# - Environment variables instead of secrets.toml

[snowflake]
user = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
account = "your_account_identifier"  # e.g., "xy12345.us-east-1"
warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"
database = "FILE_INGEST_DB"
schema = "PUBLIC"

# Alternative: Use environment variables
# The app will also check for these environment variables:
# SNOWFLAKE_USER
# SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD
# SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT
# SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE
# SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE
# SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA
